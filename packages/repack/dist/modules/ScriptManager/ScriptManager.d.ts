/**
 * A manager to ease resolution, downloading and executing additional code from:
 * - arbitrary JavaScript scripts
 * - Webpack chunks
 * - Webpack bundles
 * - Webpack MF containers
 *
 * ScriptManager is globally available under `ScriptManager.shared` in main bundle, chunks and containers.
 *
 * Use `ScriptManager.shared` instead of creating new instance of `ScriptManager`.
 *
 * This API is mainly useful, if you are working with any form of Code Splitting.
 *
 * `ScriptManager` is also an `EventEmitter` and emits the following events:
 * - `resolving` with `{ scriptId, caller }`
 * - `resolved` with `scriptId: string, caller?: string, locator: NormalizedScriptLocator, cache: boolean`
 * - `prefetching` with `scriptId: string, caller?: string, locator: NormalizedScriptLocator, cache: boolean`
 * - `loading` with `scriptId: string, caller?: string, locator: NormalizedScriptLocator, cache: boolean`
 * - `loaded` with `scriptId: string, caller?: string, locator: NormalizedScriptLocator, cache: boolean`
 * - `error` with `error: Error`
 *
 * Example of using this API with async Webpack chunk:
 * ```js
 * import * as React from 'react';
 * import { ScriptManager, Script } from '@callstack/repack/client';
 *
 * ScriptManager.shared.addResolver(async (scriptId) => {
 *   if (__DEV__) {
 *     return {
 *       url: Script.getDevServerURL(scriptId);
 *       cache: false,
 *     };
 *   }
 *
 *   return {
 *     url: Script.getRemoteURL(`http://domain.exaple/apps/${scriptId}`),
 *   };
 * });
 *
 * // ScriptManager.shared.loadScript is called internally when running `import()`
 * const TeacherModule = React.lazy(() => import('./Teacher.js'));
 * const StudentModule = React.lazy(() => import('./Student.js'));
 *
 * export function App({ role }) {
 *   if (role === 'teacher') {
 *     return <TeacherModule />;
 *   }
 *
 *   return <StudentModule />
 * }
 * ```
