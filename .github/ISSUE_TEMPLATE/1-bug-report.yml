      description:
        "Please provide a link to a repository that can reproduce the problem you encountered.
        A minimal reproduction is idealâ€”focus on isolating the bug without extra dependencies or irrelevant code.
        If you need guidance, see [this guide on creating a minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example).
        Issues without a reproduction repository are difficult to investigate and are very likely to stall."

        whether the problem only occurs in release mode, only on specific platforms, or under certain conditions.
        The more precise and detailed your steps are, the easier it is for us to replicate and address the bug."
