Re.Pack is a next generation of [Haul](https://github.com/callstack/haul) ‚Äî a Webpack-based bundler for React Native applications.

Re.Pack uses Webpack 5 and React Native CLI's plugin system to allow you to bundle your application using Webpack and allow to easily switch from Metro.

**Check the base [`webpack.config.cjs`](https://github.com/callstack/repack/blob/main/templates/webpack.config.cjs) or [`webpack.config.mjs`](https://github.com/callstack/repack/blob/main/templates/webpack.config.mjs) template, if you're curious how it all looks like.**
